## Challenges Faced

Being this the first professional webpage that I had to build, the whole project was a challenge.

Trying to figure out how HTML and CSS work together was one of the most challenging things, as there are thousands of way how one language can interact with each other.

#

## What I learned

- HTML elements and their possible attributes and values

- CSS selectors, classes and pseudoclasses.

- SASS preprocessor language. It's really handy to learn because it simplifies CSS writing.

- How to use Materialize CSS and its components. Also, its grid system that allows you to organize the layout of the webpage easier.
